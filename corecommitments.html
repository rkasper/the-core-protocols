    <h1>The Core Commitments</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I commit to engage when present.<ol>
                <li>To know and disclose<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>what I want,</li>
                        <li>what I think, and<br></li>
                        <li>what I feel.<br></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>To always seek effective help.</li>
                <li>To decline to offer and refuse to accept incoherent emotional transmissions.</li>
                <li>When I have or hear a better idea than the currently prevailing idea, I will immediately either<ol>
                        <li>propose it for decisive acceptance or rejection, and/or</li>
                        <li>explicitly seek its improvement.<br></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>I will personally support the best idea<ol>
                        <li>regardless of its source,</li>
                        <li>however much I hope an even better idea may later arise, and</li>
                        <li>when I have no superior alternative idea.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>I will seek to perceive more than I seek to be perceived.</li>
        <li>I will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks.<br></li>
        <li>I will speak always and only when I believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio.<br></li>
        <li>I will offer and accept only rational, results-oriented behavior and communication.<br></li>
        <li>I will disengage from less productive situations<br>
            <ol>
                <li>When I cannot keep these commitments,<br></li>
                <li>When it is more important that I engage elsewhere.<br></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>I will do now what must be done eventually and can effectively be done now.<br></li>
        <li>I will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing my behavior toward action.<br></li>
        <li>I will use the&nbsp;<a href="/">Core Protocols</a>&nbsp;(or better) when applicable.<br>
            <ol>
                <li>I will offer and accept timely and proper use of the&nbsp;<a href="protocols/protocolcheck.html">Protocol Check</a>&nbsp;protocol without prejudice.<br></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>I will neither harm — nor tolerate the harming of — anyone for his or her fidelity to these commitments.<br></li>
        <li>I will never do anything dumb on purpose.<br></li>
    </ol>
