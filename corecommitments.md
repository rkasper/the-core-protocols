# The Core Commitments
1. I commit to engage when present.
    1. To know and disclose
        1. what I want,
        2. what I think, and
        3. what I feel.
    2. To always seek effective help.
    3. To decline to offer and refuse to accept incoherent emotional transmissions.
    4. When I have or hear a better idea than the currently prevailing idea, I will immediately either
        1. propose it for decisive acceptance or rejection, and/or
        2. explicitly seek its improvement.
    5. I will personally support the best idea
        1. regardless of its source,
        2. however much I hope an even better idea may later arise, and
        3. when I have no superior alternative idea.
2. I will seek to perceive more than I seek to be perceived.
3. I will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks.
4. I will speak always and only when I believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio.
5. I will offer and accept only rational, results-oriented behavior and communication.
6. I will disengage from less productive situations
    1. When I cannot keep these commitments,
    2. When it is more important that I engage elsewhere.
7. I will do now what must be done eventually and can effectively be done now.
8. I will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing my behavior toward action.
9. I will use the Core Protocols (or better) when applicable.
    1. I will offer and accept timely and proper use of the Protocol Check protocol without prejudice.
10. I will neither harm — nor tolerate the harming of — anyone for his or her fidelity to these commitments.
11. I will never do anything dumb on purpose.
