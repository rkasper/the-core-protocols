    <h1><strong>Listen</strong><br></h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Use when one or two people decide to listen. You can use this protocol to understand someone better. The listen protocol may be used for conflict resolution or other purposes.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Person A and Person B sit in 2 chairs. (knees pointing toward each other) Optionally, Person C sits next to them and makes sure they follow the protocol.<br></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Person A and Person B state their personal alignments.<br></li>
        <li>Person A begins saying what he wants to say to Person B in short chunks.<br></li>
        <li>For each chunk Person B repeats back what he heard in his own words (verbatim is ok).<br></li>
        <li>Person B asks Person A “Is that right?”<br></li>
        <li>Person A either says yes (goto 6) or no and repeats the chunk at step 2 until Person A says Yes to the question “Is that right?”<br></li>
        <li>Person B asks “Is there more?” If Person A says yes, he goes to the next chunk using step 2. If Person A says no then the positions switch (optional) and Person B begins saying what he wants to say beginning at step 2.<br></li>
        <li>The positions keep switching until both are done saying what they want to say.<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you can’t stay in protocol,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html">checkout</a>.<br></li>
        <li>If you don’t understand something that is said to you when you are the listener, you may ask a question.<br></li>
        <li>You may not argue, correct, make statements, or do anything else except ask a question (with the intention of understanding what you are hearing) when you are the listener.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We would like to thank Rich and Char Tosi for the Listen which is an adaptation of their own Knees-to-Knees process.<br></li>
