    <h1><strong>Meet</strong></h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Use when one or more people meet to accomplish something.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="../protocols/checkin.html">Check In</a>.<br></li>
        <li>State What You Want. State, in a succinct way, what you want to get from this meeting.<br>
            <div>
                <p>Examples:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“I want to know what our message is for this version.”<br></li>
                    <li>“I want ideas for how to improve morale on this team.”<br></li>
                    <li>“I want to&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/perfectiongame.html">Perfection Game</a>&nbsp;how that last customer meeting went.”<br></li>
                    <li>If you want what someone else wants in the meeting, you may state that as your Meeting Alignment. Example: “I want the same thing that Joe wants.”<br></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Alignment Check.<br>
            <div>
                <p>At any point during the meeting, especially when a lull occurs or someone is off topic, say “Alignment Check.” At that point each person states, from 1 to 10, where he or she is in getting what he or she wants. Whoever has the lowest score is expected to lead in attaining what he wants. If you give yourself a 10 during an Alignment Check, this means you have gotten what you wanted and may leave the meeting if desired.<br></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>State a new Want.<br></li>
                    <li>If you have agreed to help someone get what they want, then you would stay until they have gotten their want.<br></li>
                    <li><a href="../protocols/checkout.html">Check Out</a></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Examples:<br></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>“Alignment Check”<br></li>
                    <li>“9”<br></li>
                    <li>“2”<br></li>
                    <li>“10”<br></li>
                    <li>“8”<br></li>
                    <li>“Sue, you said 2, so let’s work on yours.”<br></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Adding Wants (Optional).<br>
            <div>
                <p>If you are at a 10 in getting what you wanted, you may add a new Want.<br></p>
                <p>Example:<br></p>
                <p>“I want to add a new Want. I want to give the team my idea about how to ship this product earlier.”<br></p>
                <p>At that point, proceed to get the new Want until you are at a 10.<br></p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><a href="../protocols/checkout.html">Check Out</a>.<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>State a new Want.<br></li>
                    <li>If you have agreed to help someone get what they want, then you would stay until they have gotten their want.<br></li>
