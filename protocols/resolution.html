    <h1><strong>Resolution</strong></h1>
    <p>When a&nbsp;<a href="decider.html">Decider</a>&nbsp;vote yields a small minority of dissenters, the proposer quickly leads the team, in a highly structured fashion, to deal with them. The Resolution protocol promotes forward momentum by focusing on bringing dissenters in at least cost.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Proposer asks dissenter “What will it take to get you in?”<br></li>
        <li>Dissenter states in a single, short, declarative sentence the precise modification he or she requires to be in.<br></li>
        <li>Proposer offers to adopt the dissenter’s changes or withdraws the proposal.<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the dissenter’s changes are simple, the proposer performs a simple eye check to determine if everyone is still in.<br></li>
        <li>If the dissenter’s changes are complex, the proposer must withdraw the current proposal and then submit a new proposal that incorporates the dissenter’s changes.<br></li>
        <li>If the dissenter begins to say why he voted no or anything other than what it will take to get him or her in, the proposer must interrupt the dissenter with “What will it take to get you in?”</li>
    </ul>
