    <h1><strong>Intention Check</strong><br></h1>
    <p>Use an Intention Check to clarify the purpose of your own or another’s behavior. Use it when you expect current behavior to result in other than a positive outcome. Intention Check assesses the integrity of your own and another’s intention in a given case.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the person whose intention you want to know “What is your/my intention with X?”, where X equals some type of actual or pending behavior.<br></li>
        <li>If it would be helpful, ask “What response or behavior did you want from whom as a result of X?”<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be aware of your own intention before checking the intention of another.<br></li>
        <li>Investigate sufficiently to uncover the intention of the person or his actions.<br></li>
        <li>Make sure you have the intention to resolve any possible conflict peacefully before intention-checking someone else. If you do not have a peaceful intention,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html">check out</a>.<br></li>
        <li>Do not be defensive when someone asks you what your intention is. If you can’t do this,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html">check out</a>.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If conflict arises that seems irresolvable,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html">check out</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html">ask for help</a>.</li>
    </ul>
