    <h1><strong>Check In</strong><br></h1>
    <p>Use Check In to begin meetings or anytime an individual or group check-in would add more value to the current team interactions.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Speaker says “I feel [one or more of mad, sad, glad, afraid].” Speaker may provide a brief explanation. If others have already checked in, the speaker may say “I pass.” (See the&nbsp;<a href="pass.html">Pass</a>&nbsp;protocol.)<br></li>
        <li>Speaker says “I’m in.” This signifies that Speaker intends to behave according to the&nbsp;<a href="../corecommitments.html">Core Commitments</a>.<br></li>
        <li>Listeners respond “Welcome.”<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>State feelings without qualification.<br></li>
        <li>State feelings only as they pertain to yourself.<br></li>
        <li>Be silent during another’s Check In.<br></li>
        <li>Do not refer to another’s check-in disclosures without explicitly granted permission from him or her.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the context of the Core Protocols, all emotions are expressed through combinations of mad, sad, glad, or afraid. For example, “excited” may be a combination of glad and afraid.<br></li>
        <li>Check In as deeply as possible. Checking in with two or more emotions is the norm. The depth of a group’s check-in translates directly to the quality of the group’s results.<br></li>
        <li>Do not do anything to diminish your emotional state. Do not describe yourself as a “little” mad, sad, glad, or afraid or say “I’m mad, but I’m still glad.”<br></li>
        <li>Except in large groups, if more than one person checks in, it is recommended that all do so.<br></li>
        <li>“Happy” may be substituted for “glad”, and “scared” may be substituted for “afraid”.</li>
    </ul>
