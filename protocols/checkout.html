    <h1><strong>Check Out</strong><br></h1>
    <p>Check Out requires that your physical presence always signifies your engagement. You must check out when you are aware that you cannot maintain the&nbsp;<a href="../corecommitments.html">Core Commitments</a>&nbsp;or whenever it would be better for you to be elsewhere.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Say “I’m checking out.”<br></li>
        <li>Physically leave the group until you’re ready to&nbsp;<a href="checkin.html">check in</a>&nbsp;once again.<br></li>
        <li>Optionally, if it is known and relevant, you can say when you believe you’ll return.<br></li>
        <li>Those who are present for the check-out may not follow the person, talk to or about the person checking out, or otherwise chase him or her.<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Return as soon as you can and are able to keep the&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/corecommitments.html">Core Commitments</a>.<br></li>
        <li>Return and&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html">check in</a>&nbsp;without unduly calling attention to your return.<br></li>
        <li>Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate, or punish anyone who checks out.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you check out, do it as calmly and gracefully as possible so as to cause minimal disruption to others.<br></li>
        <li>Check out if your emotional state is hindering your success, if your receptivity to new information is too low, or if you do not know what you want.<br></li>
        <li>Checking out is an admission that you are unable to contribute at the present time.</li>
    </ul>
