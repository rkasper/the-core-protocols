    <h1>Pass (Unpass)</h1>
    <p>The Pass protocol is how you decline to participate in something. Use it anytime you don’t want to participate in an activity.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>When you’ve decided not to participate, say “I pass.”<br></li>
        <li>Unpass any time you desire. Unpass as soon as you know you want to participate again by saying “I unpass.”<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hold reasons for passing private.<br></li>
        <li>Pass on something as soon as you are aware you are going to pass.<br></li>
        <li>Respect the right of others to pass without explanation.<br></li>
        <li>Support those who pass by not discussing them or their pass.<br></li>
        <li>Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate, or punish anyone who passes.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In general, you will not be in good standing with your&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/corecommitments.html">Core Commitments</a>&nbsp;if you pass most of the time.<br></li>
        <li>You can pass on any activity; however, if you have adopted the&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/corecommitments.html">Core Commitments</a>, you cannot pass on a&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider.html">Decider</a>&nbsp;vote and you must say “I’m in” when&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html">checking in</a>.<br></li>
        <li>You can pass even though you have already started something.</li>
    </ul>
