# Investigate
The Investigate protocol allows you to learn about a phenomenon that occurs in someone else. Use it when an idea or behavior someone is presenting seems poor, confusing, or simply interesting.

## Steps
1. Act as if you were a detached but fascinated inquirer, asking questions until your curiosity is satisfied or you no longer want to ask questions.

## Commitments
* Ask well-formed questions.
* Ask only questions that will increase your understanding.
* Ask questions only if the subject is engaged and appears ready to answer more.
* Refrain from offering opinions.
* Do not ask leading questions where you think you know how he or she will answer.
* If you cannot remain a detached, curious investigator with no agenda, stop using the protocol until you can come back to it and keep these commitments.

## Notes
* Do not theorize about the subject or provide any sort of diagnosis.
* Consider using the following forms for your questions:
    * What about X makes you Y, Z?
    * Would you explain a specific example?
    * How does X go when it happens?
    * What is the one thing you want most from solving X?
    * What is the biggest problem you see regarding X now?
    * What is the most important thing you could do right now to help you with X?
* Ineffective queries include questions that:
    * lead or reflect an agenda,
    * attempt to hide an answer you believe is true,
    * invite stories, or
    * begin with “why".
* Stick to your intention of gathering more information.
* If you feel that you will explode if you can’t say what’s on your mind, you shouldn’t speak at all. Consider [checking your intention](intentioncheck.md) or [checking out](checkout.md).
