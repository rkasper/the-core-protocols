    <h1><strong>Perfection Game</strong><br></h1>
    <p>The Perfection Game protocol will support you in your desire to aggregate the best ideas. Use it whenever you desire to improve something you’ve created.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Perfectee performs an act or presents an object for perfection, optionally saying “begin” and “end” to notify the perfector of the start and end of the performance.<br></li>
        <li>Perfector rates the value of the performance or object on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much value the perfector believes he or she can add.<br></li>
        <li>Perfector says “What I liked about the performance or object was X,” and proceeds to list the qualities of the object the perfector thought were valuable or should be amplified.<br></li>
        <li>Perfector offers the improvements to the performance or object required for it to be rated a 10 by saying “To make it a 10, you would have to do X.”<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Accept perfecting without argument.<br></li>
        <li>Give only positive comments: what you like and what it would take for you to give it a 10.<br></li>
        <li>Abstain from mentioning what you don’t like or being negative in other ways.<br></li>
        <li>Withhold points only if you can think of improvements.<br></li>
        <li>Use ratings that reflect a scale of improvement rather than a scale of how much you liked the object.<br></li>
        <li>If you cannot say something you liked about the object or specifically say how to make the object better, you must give it a 10.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A rating of 10 means you are unable to add value, and a rating of 5 means you will specifically describe how to make the object at least twice as good.<br></li>
        <li>The important information to transmit in the Perfection Game protocol improves the performance or object. For example, “The ideal sound of a finger snap for me is one that is crisp, has sufficient volume, and startles me somewhat. To get a 10, you would have to increase your crispness.”<br></li>
        <li>Perfectee may only ask questions to clarify or gather more information for improvement. If you disagree with the ideas given to you, simply don’t include them.</li>
    </ul>
