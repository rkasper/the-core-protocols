    <h1><strong>Investigate</strong><br></h1>
    <p>The Investigate protocol allows you to learn about a phenomenon that occurs in someone else. Use it when an idea or behavior someone is presenting seems poor, confusing, or simply interesting.<br></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Act as if you were a detached but fascinated inquirer, asking questions until your curiosity is satisfied or you no longer want to ask questions.<br></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask well-formed questions.<br></li>
        <li>Ask only questions that will increase your understanding.<br></li>
        <li>Ask questions only if the subject is engaged and appears ready to answer more.<br></li>
        <li>Refrain from offering opinions.<br></li>
        <li>Do not ask leading questions where you think you know how he or she will answer.<br></li>
        <li>If you cannot remain a detached, curious investigator with no agenda, stop using the protocol until you can come back to it and keep these commitments.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not theorize about the subject or provide any sort of diagnosis.<br></li>
        <li>Consider using the following forms for your questions:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>What about X makes you Y, Z?<br></li>
                <li>Would you explain a specific example?<br></li>
                <li>How does X go when it happens?<br></li>
                <li>What is the one thing you want most from solving X?<br></li>
                <li>What is the biggest problem you see regarding X now?<br></li>
                <li>What is the most important thing you could do right now to help you with X?<br></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ineffective queries include questions that:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>lead or reflect an agenda,<br></li>
                <li>attempt to hide an answer you believe is true,<br></li>
                <li>invite stories, or<br></li>
                <li>begin with “why”.<br></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stick to your intention of gathering more information.<br></li>
        <li>If you feel that you will explode if you can’t say what’s on your mind, you shouldn’t speak at all. Consider&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/intentioncheck.html">checking your intention</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html">checking out</a>.</li>
    </ul>
