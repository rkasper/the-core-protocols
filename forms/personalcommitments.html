    <h1><strong>Personal Commitments</strong><br></h1>
    <p>Please initial each commitment and sign at the bottom indicating you agree to the following:<br></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Safety.</strong>&nbsp;I will take care of myself, my privacy and my safety during this course. I know that I can&nbsp;<a href="../protocols/pass.html">pass</a>&nbsp;on anything and&nbsp;<a href="../protocols/checkout.html">check out</a>&nbsp;at will, with no penalties attached.&nbsp;<strong>(Initials ________)</strong><br></li>
        <li><strong>Staff.</strong>&nbsp;I want to learn about myself, about team dynamics, about my teammates, and I want to understand what the course staff understands about teams. For the duration of the course, I will suspend disbelief and adopt as a learning strategy the pretense that presented ideas are true. I want to learn efficiently and I am willing to accept the staffâ€™s guidance to find new efficiency in my learning. I will refrain from providing feedback during the course.<strong>(Initials ________)</strong><br></li>
        <li><strong>The Core Culture.</strong>&nbsp;I have read&nbsp;<a href="../corecommitments.html">The Core Commitments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="../index.html">protocols</a>&nbsp;to be used in the course. I agree to adhere to The Core commitments and protocols during the course. This includes requiring that others on my team adhere to The Core protocols and commitments.&nbsp;<strong>(Initials ________)</strong><br></li>
        <li><strong>Durability.</strong>&nbsp;If any of the above (1-3) commitments are untrue of me now or become untrue sometime during the course, I will resolve this with the staff immediately.&nbsp;<strong>(Initials ________)</strong><br></li>
